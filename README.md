This project is a system to manage a vehicle which can accelerate or brake. It takes into account factors such as fuel, vehicle oil, engine RPMs and speed. Finally, depending on the vehicle's action (Accelerating or stopping), the current value of each of the vehicle's indicators is printed to the console.
